# Bootstrap-Portfolio

# Description 
This project is mainly about recreating my already existing portfolio, however this time using BootStrap tools.

BootStrap is a quick and easily accessibile style sheet library which can be used to create website using already existing templates. 

While doing this project, I also utilized grid and flex box in the styling which made the website more responsive. At the moment, there are two deployed projects and since the website is still undergoing development, more projects will be added as soon as they get completed.
